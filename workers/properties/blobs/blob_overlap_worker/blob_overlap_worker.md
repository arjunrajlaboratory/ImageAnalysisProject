# Blob overlap

**Type:** Property Worker  
**Category:** Blobs  
**Annotation Shape:** `polygon`  
**Interface Category:** Relational  

## Description

## Interface Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Range / Options | Description |
|-----------|------|:--------:|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Annotations to compute overlap with** | `tags` |  | -- | -- |  |
| **Compute reverse overlaps** | `checkbox` |  | -- | -- |  |

## Files

| `environment.yml` | Conda environment dependencies |
| `tests/` | pytest test suite with `Dockerfile_Test` |
