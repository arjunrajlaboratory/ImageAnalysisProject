**Type:** Annotation Worker  
**Interface Category:** Connections  

## Description

This tool connects annotations to their nearest neighbors. It will connect from objects with the parent tag to objects with the child tag. Learn more

## Interface Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Range / Options | Description |
|-----------|------|:--------:|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Parent tag** | `tags` |  | -- | -- |  |
| **Child tag** | `tags` |  | -- | -- |  |
| **Connect across Z** | `select` |  | No | Yes, No | Connect objects regardless of their z-slice. For example, it will connect a parent in Z=1 to a child in Z=4. |
| **Connect across T** | `select` |  | No | Yes, No | Connect objects regardless of their time point. For example, it will connect a parent in T=1 to a child in T=4. |
| **Connect to closest centroid or edge** | `select` |  | Centroid | Centroid, Edge | Connect to the parent with either the closest centroid or closest edge. |
| **Restrict connection** | `select` |  | None | None, Touching parent, Within parent | Only connect if the child is either touching the parent or completely within the parent. |
| **Max distance (pixels)** | `number` |  | 1000 | 0 - 5000 | The maximum distance (in pixels) between the child and parent objects to be connected. Otherwise, objects will not be connected. |
| **Connect up to N children** | `number` |  | 10000 | 1 - 10000 | The maximum number of children to connect to each parent. |
