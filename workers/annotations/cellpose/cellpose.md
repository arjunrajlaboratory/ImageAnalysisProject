**GPU Support:** Yes (NVIDIA CUDA)  

## Description

This tool runs the Cellpose model to segment the image into cells. Learn more

## Interface Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Range / Options | Description |
|-----------|------|:--------:|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Batch XY** | `text` |  | -- | -- | Enter the XY positions you want to iterate over |
| **Batch Z** | `text` |  | -- | -- | Enter the Z slices you want to iterate over |
| **Batch Time** | `text` |  | -- | -- | Enter the Time points you want to iterate over |
| **Model** *(runtime)* | `select` |  | cyto3 | _runtime_ | cyto3 is the most accurate for cells, whereas nuclei is best for finding nuclei. For cyto3 and derivatives, you can put the cyt... |
| **Primary Channel** | `channel` |  | -- | -- | The channel to use for the primary segmentation. If you are segmenting cytoplasm, put your cytoplasm channel here. If you are s... |
| **Secondary Channel** | `channel` |  | none | -- | The secondary channel to use for segmentation. If you are segmenting cytoplasm, you can put your nuclei channel here. If you ar... |
| **Diameter** | `number` |  | 10 | 0 - 200 pixels | The diameter of the cells in the image. Choose as close as you can because the model is most accurate when the diameter is clos... |
| **Smoothing** | `number` |  | 0.7 | 0 - 10 | Smoothing is used to simplify the polygons. A value of 0.7 is a good default. |
| **Padding** | `number` |  | 0 | -20 - 20 pixels | Padding will expand (or, if negative, subtract) from the polygon. A value of 0 means no padding. |
| **Tile Size** | `number` |  | 1024 | 0 - 2048 pixels | The worker will split the image into tiles of this size. If they are too large, the Cellpose model may not be able to run on them. |
| **Tile Overlap** | `number` |  | 0.1 | 0 - 1 Fraction | The amount of overlap between tiles. A value of 0.1 means that the tiles will overlap by 10%, which is 102 pixels if the tile s... |

> **(runtime)** = option list is fetched at runtime (e.g. available trained models).
